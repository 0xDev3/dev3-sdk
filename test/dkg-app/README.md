# DKG App Example (Gnosis Chain)

This example demonstrates how to interact with the DKG system using the dev3-sdk dependency.
To run the example live follow the steps below:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/0xdev3/dev3-sdk
$ cd dev3-sdk
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ cd test/dkg-app
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start # starts the example dkg app at localhost:1234
```

Before running an example, make sure you got yourself a worskpace created on the [Dev3 Platform](https://app.dev3.sh). The workspace must be created on the Gnosis Chain and the Dev3 will handle the rest when interacting with the DKG.
